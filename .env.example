# ChirpSyncer Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual credentials

# ============================================================================
# Twitter Credentials (for twscrape scraping)
# ============================================================================
# You need your actual Twitter account credentials for twscrape to work.
# twscrape uses account credentials to scrape Twitter data without API limits.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - Use a dedicated Twitter account (recommended for security)
# - Enable 2FA on your account for better security
# - Keep these credentials secure and never commit them to version control
#
# Required credentials:
# - TWITTER_USERNAME: Your Twitter username (without @)
# - TWITTER_PASSWORD: Your Twitter account password
# - TWITTER_EMAIL: Email associated with your Twitter account
# - TWITTER_EMAIL_PASSWORD: Password for your email account (for verification)
#
# First-time setup:
# After setting these credentials, you'll need to run a one-time account setup.
# See the "Migration Guide" section in README.md for detailed instructions.

TWITTER_USERNAME=your_twitter_username
TWITTER_PASSWORD=your_twitter_password
TWITTER_EMAIL=your_twitter_email@example.com
TWITTER_EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password

# ============================================================================
# DEPRECATED: Twitter API Credentials (OAuth 1.0a)
# ============================================================================
# These credentials are deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
# Please migrate to the twscrape credentials above.
#
# If you're still using the old Twitter API, you can keep these for now,
# but they won't be validated anymore.

# TWITTER_API_KEY=your-twitter-api-key-here
# TWITTER_API_SECRET=your-twitter-api-secret-here
# TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-twitter-access-token-here
# TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET=your-twitter-access-secret-here

# ============================================================================
# Bluesky Credentials (AT Protocol)
# ============================================================================
# Username: Your full Bluesky handle (e.g., username.bsky.social)
# Password: Use an app-specific password, NOT your main account password
#
# To create an app password:
# 1. Log in to Bluesky
# 2. Go to Settings > App Passwords
# 3. Create a new app password for ChirpSyncer
#
# Using an app password is more secure and can be revoked independently

BSKY_USERNAME=your-username.bsky.social
BSKY_PASSWORD=your-bluesky-app-password-here

# ============================================================================
# Sprint 6: Multi-User Support Configuration
# ============================================================================

# Enable multi-user mode (default: false for backward compatibility)
# Set to 'true' to enable multi-user synchronization with web dashboard
# In single-user mode (false), credentials are read from .env as before
# In multi-user mode (true), credentials are stored encrypted in database
MULTI_USER_ENABLED=false

# Master encryption key for credential storage (REQUIRED for multi-user mode)
# This key is used to encrypt/decrypt user credentials in the database
# IMPORTANT:
# - Generate a strong random string (32+ characters recommended)
# - Keep this secret and never commit to version control
# - If you lose this key, all encrypted credentials will be unrecoverable
# - Use: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here-generate-with-secrets-module

# Admin user configuration (for first-time multi-user setup)
# When multi-user mode is enabled and no users exist, an admin user is created
# If ADMIN_PASSWORD is not set, a random password will be generated and shown in logs
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@chirpsyncer.local
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-strong-admin-password-here
