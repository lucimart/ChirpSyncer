# DOCS

## OVERVIEW
Project documentation including architecture, API, database, and roadmap.

## WHERE TO LOOK
| Task | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Source of truth | docs/MASTER_ROADMAP.md | Status + plan
| Architecture | docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md | System design
| API reference | docs/API.md | Public interfaces
| Database schema | docs/DATABASE.md | SQLite tables
| UI/UX plan | docs/UI_UX_REDESIGN_PLAN.md | UI roadmap

## CONVENTIONS
- MASTER_ROADMAP.md is treated as source of truth.
- UI/UX innovations are summarized in docs/UI_UX_INNOVATIONS.md.

## ANTI-PATTERNS
- Avoid duplicating roadmap details outside MASTER_ROADMAP.md.
