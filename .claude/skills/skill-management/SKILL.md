# Skill: Skill Management

This is a meta-skill that manages other skills. Use it to create, update, and improve skills based on project evolution.

## Auto-Improvement Protocol

### When to Update Skills

After completing significant work, evaluate if skills need updating:

1. **New Pattern Discovered**: If you implemented something in a new way
2. **API Changed**: If endpoints, schemas, or contracts changed
3. **Architecture Evolved**: If system design changed
4. **New Component**: If a new module/component was added
5. **Bug Pattern**: If a recurring bug pattern was identified
6. **Best Practice**: If a better approach was found
